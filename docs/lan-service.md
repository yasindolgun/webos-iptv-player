# LAN Setup Service

A bundled webOS JS service that lets a phone or computer on the same LAN
configure Playlist URLs, Xtream accounts, and an EPG URL, upload an `.m3u`
playlist, or transfer a credential-free user-data backup. The TV-side app
consumes these changes through Luna.

The service targets webOS TV 4.x's Node.js 0.12.2 runtime. TypeScript emits
ES5/CommonJS, and `scripts/service-compat-gate.mjs` scans the final JavaScript
for newer syntax and APIs. `bundled-service/src/compat.ts` prefers native APIs
on newer TVs and supplies focused fallbacks for Node 0.12.

- **Luna bus** — in-process IPC between the app and the service.
- **HTTP** — `0.0.0.0:<ephemeral>` for phones, `127.0.0.1:<same>` for the app's reconcile fetches.

## APIs

The service exposes the Luna methods and HTTP routes below.

Luna (called by the app's LAN/reminder clients and by Activity Manager):

| Method | Subscribe? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | no | Bind the HTTP server; returns the bound port. Idempotent. |
| `stop` | no | Close the HTTP server and release the keepAlive activity. |
| `heartbeat` | no | Liveness probe; returns `{running, port}`. |
| `serviceEvents` | **yes** | Push channel for upload, setup, and backup changes. |
| `getDevMode` | no | Report whether Developer Mode is available for interactive reminder alerts. |
| `fireReminderAlert` | no | Raise the Developer Mode reminder alert requested by Activity Manager. |

HTTP (called by phones, and by the app for reconcile):

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/info` | GET | Loopback-only metadata, including setup URLs and the pairing code. |
| `/` or `/setup` | GET | Public setup page; asks for the TV pairing code. |
| `/setup#token=…` | GET | QR entry that opens the same page already authorized. |
| `/pair` | POST | Rate-limited exchange of the four-digit code for the setup token. |
| `/setup-state` | PUT | Loopback-only sanitized source state, including enabled flags, published by the TV. |
| `/setup-state?token=…` | GET | Sanitized source and online-subtitle state for the setup page. |
| `/setup-actions?token=…` | POST | Validate and queue a source or online-subtitle change. |
| `/setup-actions` | GET | Loopback-only list consumed by the TV app. |
| `/setup-actions/:id` | DELETE | Loopback-only acknowledgement from the TV app. |
| `/setup-actions/:id?token=…` | GET | Phone-facing application status. |
| `/uploads[?token=…]` | GET | List uploads; loopback callers need no token. |
| `/uploads?name=foo.m3u&token=…` | POST | Save a playlist; fires `serviceEvents`. |
| `/uploads/:id[.m3u][?token=…]` | GET | Serve an upload; loopback callers need no token. |
| `/uploads/:id?token=…` | DELETE | Remove an upload; loopback callers do not need the token. |
| `/backup` | PUT | Loopback-only publication of the current credential-free archive. |
| `/backup?token=…&groups=…` | GET | Download only the selected archive groups. |
| `/backup-import?token=…` | POST | Queue a Merge or Replace import. |
| `/backup-import` | GET | Loopback-only pending imports consumed by the TV app. |
| `/backup-import/:id` | PUT | Loopback-only success/error acknowledgement. |
| `/backup-import/:id?token=…` | GET | Phone-facing import status. |

## Event-driven updates

When a phone uploads, deletes, submits a source change, or queues a backup, the TV updates
within milliseconds. There is **no background polling**.

A successful POST or DELETE on the HTTP side calls an `onChange` hook,
which iterates the active `serviceEvents` subscriber list and calls
`msg.respond({event})` on each one. Upload events refresh `/uploads`.
Setup events make `SetupClient` consume the pending actions, update the
existing `StorageService` models, publish a sanitized `/setup-state` snapshot,
acknowledge each action, and reload data. The phone waits for that
acknowledgement before showing “Saved on TV”. Source-removal actions use the
same queue, so deleting a Playlist or Xtream account remains idempotent.
Source-enable actions also use this queue for URL, Xtream, and uploaded
playlists; missing `enabled` fields remain backward-compatible and mean enabled.

`BackupClient` publishes a fresh archive when the service starts, Settings
opens, or Settings saves. A phone download selects groups without expanding the
archive's allowlist. An import remains queued until the app validates every
selected group, updates the IndexedDB user stores in one transaction, applies
the small preference values, and reports success or an actionable error. Merge
is keyed and idempotent; Replace clears only the selected logical groups. The
app reloads after a successful restore.

The TV also publishes state after service startup and local Settings changes.
The setup page refreshes the snapshot periodically. Xtream snapshots contain
the account id, display name, server URL, and username, but never the password.
Online-subtitle snapshots contain only the preferred language and configured
flags for each provider, plus the OpenSubtitles username. API keys, passwords,
and login tokens never leave the TV. Backup archives also exclude source and
account configuration, provider credentials, stream URLs, subtitle downloads,
caches, and uploaded M3U files. Poster/icon URLs and transient playback queues
are removed from exported viewing records. The phone shows configured secrets as a
fixed `********` mask that does not reveal their length. An unchanged mask
preserves the value, one delete clears the field, and replacement text updates
only that field.

Rejected uploads (HTTP 400) and missing-id deletes (HTTP 404) do **not**
fire the event.

Uploaded files remain server-authoritative. Setup actions remain in a shared
in-memory queue until the TV acknowledges them. If the app misses a push,
bundled-service initialization consumes the queue after reconnecting.

## Setup authorization

Every HTTP bind generates a random 32-character token. `/info` is available
only over loopback, so only the TV app can obtain the tokenized setup URL for
the QR code. The QR keeps the token in the URL fragment, which browsers do not
send in the initial HTTP request; the setup page attaches it only to protected
API calls. `/info` also returns a random four-digit code for computers that
open the short root URL manually. The public page exchanges that code for the
full token; five failures from one client lock pairing for one minute.

The token is required to submit source changes, query their status, upload M3U
files, download or import a backup, read the sanitized setup state, or remotely
list, read, or delete uploads. Publishing
state and reading or acknowledging queued actions is loopback-only, which
prevents another LAN client from injecting state or reading Xtream
credentials. Upload identifiers are validated before file access so requests
cannot escape the upload directory. A new foreground bind creates a new token,
pairing code, and URL, invalidating the old values.

## Foreground / background lifecycle

The service is tied to the app's visibility. When the app is backgrounded
(`visibilitychange → hidden`) the app calls Luna `stop`, which closes the
HTTP listener and releases the `keepAlive` activity — neither the LAN
port nor the service process lingers while other webOS apps are in use.

When the app is foregrounded (`visibilitychange → visible`) it calls
Luna `start` again, which re-binds the HTTP server on a new ephemeral
port and resubscribes to `serviceEvents`. `Settings.refreshSetupInfo()` and
`Settings.refreshUploads()` run so the QR code and upload list reflect the
new port and current state.

The service process itself stays alive across stop/start cycles — only
the HTTP server is torn down. Luna respawns the process on cold start
(first call to `start` after a TV reboot or app uninstall).

## Why this shape?

- **Why a separate process?** webOS sandboxes the app and won't let it
  open a server socket on a non-loopback interface. The bundled service
  runs alongside but independently.
- **Why an OS-assigned port?** A fixed port (e.g. 8890) collides
  unpredictably with whatever else is running on the TV. The OS-assigned
  port is reported back through Luna's `start` response, so the app and
  the phone always agree.
- **Why Luna push and not polling?** Polling wakes the device ~20×/min
  per active Settings view to detect a change that happens maybe twice
  per session, and adds 1–3s lag. Push is built into the platform — one
  `subscribe: true` request from the app, `msg.respond()` from the
  service.
- **Why stop/start on background?** Holding an open LAN port and a
  keepAlive activity while the app is invisible is wasteful and a small
  attack surface. Closing it on hidden costs only a fresh `listen(0)`
  when the app returns.
- **Why M3U only — why not EPG upload too?** The upload plumbing is
  content-agnostic and could carry an XMLTV file just as easily, but it
  would be the wrong model for EPG:
  - **EPG is time-sensitive; an upload is a frozen snapshot.** The app
    refreshes EPG periodically and keeps only a ±7-day program window
    (`src/services/epg-service.ts`, `src/parsers/xmltv-parser.ts`). An
    uploaded XMLTV file is stale within a day or two and effectively
    empty within a week — so the user would have to re-upload every
    couple of days, forever. A playlist, by contrast, is static: upload
    once and it stays valid. Upload fits M3U precisely because M3U
    doesn't expire.
  - **EPG almost always travels as a URL.** It's embedded in the M3U
    header (`x-tvg-url` / `url-tvg`, auto-detected) or fetched from a
    public aggregator. The "I have a file but no hosted URL" gap that
    justifies M3U upload barely exists for EPG.
  - **The local-source case is already covered — and stays fresh.** The
    manual EPG URL field in **Settings → EPG**, plus the
    localhost→playlist-host rewrite in `src/services/playlist-service.ts`
    (for users running a local proxy like xTeVe/Threadfin that serves
    M3U and XMLTV from the same box), let the TV *pull* fresh EPG by URL.
    Pull stays current automatically; a push upload does not. For EPG,
    pull strictly dominates.

  If genuine demand for fully offline, file-based EPG ever shows up, the
  better shape is a per-playlist EPG URL the TV can re-pull, not a
  one-shot upload that throws away the freshness guarantee.
